# BankDB

This is a python made project that is to learn the basics of Python - DataBase linkage method.

This python project imports sqlite3 module to connect to and fetch from the DataBase.

I used sqlite3 for database.

You need to have the same db file name and same table structure in order to use the code without any modification.

This will be a practical example of how to select, insert, delete, update from the database using python
