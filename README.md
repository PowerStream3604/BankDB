# BankDB

This is a python made project that is to learn the basics of Python - DataBase linkage method.

This python project imports sqlite3 module to connect to and fetch from the DataBase.

I used sqlite3 for database.

You need to have the same db file name and same table structure in order to use the code without any modification.

This will be a practical example of how to select, insert, delete, update from the database using python

## Bank.py
This file has the getters and setters for attribute.

This file also has initializer to initialize the variables

## Bank_sqlite.py
This is the actual file that creates the DB connection, prints the menu, fetch, delete, insert, update to and from the DataBase 

There are several options that the main menu proposes once you execute the file which you can easily understand.
